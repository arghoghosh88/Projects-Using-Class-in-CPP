# 🎓 Student SGPA Calculator (C++)

## Project Description
The **Student SGPA Calculator** is a console-based application developed using **C++**
and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.  
The system calculates a student’s **Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)** based on
course-wise marks and predefined credit hours following a standard university grading
policy.

This project is designed for academic purposes and helps understand how grading systems
work programmatically.

---

## Objectives
- To calculate SGPA using a credit-based grading system
- To apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts in C++
- To convert marks into grade points automatically
- To design semester-wise course handling
- To improve logical and modular programming skills

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Compiler:** GCC / CodeBlocks
- **Standard Library:** `<bits/stdc++.h>`

## Program Workflow
1. Student enters name
2. Selects semester (First or Second)
3. Inputs marks for each course
4. Marks are converted to grade points
5. Grade points are multiplied by credit values
6. SGPA is calculated using total credits
7. Final SGPA is displayed

---

## Features
- Semester-wise SGPA calculation  
- Automatic grade point conversion  
- Credit-weighted result calculation  
- Simple and easy-to-use interface  
- Accurate SGPA up to three decimal places  

---

## Limitations
- Console-based application only  
- No CGPA calculation  
- No file or database storage  
- No validation for invalid marks  
- Supports only two semesters  

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add CGPA calculation for multiple semesters  
- Validate marks input (0–100)  
- Support additional semesters  
- Implement file handling to save results  
- Develop GUI-based version  
- Improve grading system flexibility  

---

## Learning Outcomes
- Practical understanding of SGPA calculation  
- Hands-on experience with OOP in C++  
- Improved logic-building skills  
- Better understanding of academic grading systems  
- Experience writing structured academic code
