# 🧮 Simple Calculator (C++)

## Project Description
The **Simple Calculator** is a console-based C++ application that performs basic
arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and
trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec).  

The program is designed using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, making
it modular, reusable, and easy to extend.  

---

## Objectives
- Perform basic arithmetic calculations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Perform trigonometric operations using angles in degrees
- Apply Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Provide a simple and interactive user interface
- Handle basic error cases, such as division by zero

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming
- **Compiler:** GCC / CodeBlocks
- **Libraries Used:** `<bits/stdc++.h>`, `<cmath>`, `<iomanip>`

## Project Structure

---

## OOP Concepts Used
- Class and Object
- Member functions for operations
- Encapsulation of calculator functions
- Modularity
- Conditional statements
- Looping for menu-driven operations

---

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
- Trigonometric operations: sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec
- Accepts angles in degrees and converts to radians automatically
- Continuous menu-driven interface
- Handles division by zero error
- Easy-to-use and interactive interface

---

## Limitations
- Console-based application only
- No GUI interface
- No input validation for non-numeric input
- Trigonometric results may have limited precision
- Only supports angles in degrees

---

## Future Enhancements
- Add memory storage and recall functionality
- Add logarithmic and exponential operations
- Implement input validation for all operations
- Add GUI version for better usability
- Improve precision of trigonometric calculations

---

## Program Workflow
1. Display menu of operations
2. Accept user choice
3. Input two numbers for arithmetic operations or one angle for trigonometry
4. Perform calculation using calculator class methods
5. Display result
6. Repeat until user chooses exit (0)
